**Date:** 2026-01-04

**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Objective

To provide definitive, CI-backed evidence for the completion of Stage 1.2, which was previously validated only through local execution. This phase closes the governance loop by ensuring that all changes for Stage 1.2 pass the full, rigorous CI pipeline.

## 2. Evidence of Completion

A pull request, PR #6, was created to merge the `stage-1.2-policy-consistency` branch into `main`. This action triggered the CI workflow, and all checks passed successfully.

| Item | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pull Request** | PR #6: Stage 1.0-1.2 Production Hardening + Policy Consistency | [Link](https://github.com/cgtqwmwkhp-rgb/quality-governance-platform/pull/6) |
| **CI Run** | Successful CI execution for PR #6 | [Link](https://github.com/cgtqwmwkhp-rgb/quality-governance-platform/pull/6/checks) |

This successful CI run serves as the official, immutable evidence that all Stage 1.2 deliverables meet the project's quality and governance standards.

## 3. Phase Outcome

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

This phase successfully addressed the evidence gap from Stage 1.2. The successful CI run on PR #6 provides the necessary assurance to proceed with further development, confident that the codebase is stable and compliant.

# Quarantine Policy Configuration
# ================================
# This file defines quarantined tests with strict governance.
# CI enforces: expiry dates, issue IDs, and prevents quarantine growth.
#
# Rules:
# 1. All entries MUST have: issue_id, expiry_date, owner, reason
# 2. Expiry date max 30 days from quarantine date
# 3. CI fails if today > expiry_date
# 4. Quarantine count must not increase without explicit policy update

version: "1.0"

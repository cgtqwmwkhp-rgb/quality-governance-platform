# Quarantine Policy Configuration
# ================================
# This file defines quarantined tests with strict governance.
# CI enforces: expiry dates, issue IDs, and prevents quarantine growth.
#
# Rules:
# 1. All entries MUST have: issue_id, expiry_date, owner, reason
# 2. Expiry date max 30 days from quarantine date
# 3. CI fails if today > expiry_date
# 4. Quarantine count must not increase without explicit policy update

# Quarantine entries
# NOTE: As of 2026-02-21 all formerly-skipped E2E tests have been converted
# from pytest.mark.skip to pytest.mark.xfail(strict=False).  They now RUN and
# REPORT but do not BLOCK CI.  Entries below are kept for tracking until the
# root causes are fully resolved.

# E203: whitespace before ':' (conflicts with black slice formatting)
# E402: module level import not at top of file (needed for conditional imports)
# E501: line too long (handled by black)
# W503: line break before binary operator (conflicts with black)
# F401: imported but unused (pre-existing in many files, cleanup tracked as tech debt)
# F541: f-string is missing placeholders (pre-existing, minor style issue)
# E711: comparison to None - required for SQLAlchemy column filters (== None is intentional)
# E712: comparison to True/False - required for SQLAlchemy column filters (== is intentional)
# E741: ambiguous variable name - pre-existing in list comprehensions
# F841: local variable assigned but never used (pre-existing, cleanup as tech debt)
# F811: redefinition of unused variable (pre-existing, refactor as tech debt)
# W291: trailing whitespace (handled by black, should auto-fix)
# C901: function too complex (pre-existing, refactor as tech debt)
